# Diagnosis-of-Heart-Disease-using-Multiple-Logistic-Regression
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in all around the world . The data contain 303 records. Used several data mining techniques to help health care professionals in the diagnosis of heart disease.  Used multiple logistic regression model which is developed to predict a person's likelihood of having heart disease given his/her age, sex, and maximum heart rate. Translated the predicted probability into a decision rule for clinical use by defining a cutoff value on the probability scale. When an individual comes in for a health check-up, the doctor would like to know the predicted probability of heart disease. Created a newdata data frame to save a new case information .

Used some common metrics to evaluate the model performance such as accuracy, confusion matrix, AUC, classification error rate.
